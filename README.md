# Beezwax Recruiting Exercise Dev Environment
This repo presents a base Rails 5 install for the standard Beezwax recruiting exercise so that you can spend your time writing code and not configuring an environment.

Clone like so:

    git clone git@github.com:beezwax/recruiting-exercise.git beezwax-exercise && cd beezwax-exercise && bundle install

Both MiniTest and Rspec are available, and it includes haml. Feel free to use any library you want.

## Do not create a public repo
We'd prefer not to have solutions to the exercise around in the wild. Please do *not* create a public repo. Instead, either submit your solution via pull request against this repo (so we can make a local copy of, and then delete, your branch), or via email.

## Submit the exercise using GitHub
The recommended way to submit the exercise is to create a new branch with your solution simply make a new PR to this repo:

    git checkout -b Your-Name

To keep things organized, the branch should be your full name.

At the scheduled time of your exercise, you will receive instructions on what to build. We'll send your solution around the team for review; you should hear back from us within a day or two.

## Submit the exercise using Email
If you don't want to use GitHub, once you're done, please zip up your solution and return it to us, simply email it at careers@beezwax.net.

### Using Gmail
Gmail now blocks attachments with javascript files (as well as compressed archives that include js files).

Since we ask you not to put your solution in a public repository, the best way to return it would be to make the archive available via Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar, and send us the link.
